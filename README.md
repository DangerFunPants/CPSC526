# CPSC 526 - Network Security
This repo contains various problems that were assigned as part of the course requirements for the upper years network security course offered at the University of Calgary. Since there is no specific requirements as to the programming language used for these assignments, i've been attempting to implement the problems in a variety of unique and interesting programming languages. So far the following have been used:
* Rust
* Haskell

A list of potential languages to use in the future might include
* Crystal
* Go
* Julia
* OCaml
* PureScript
* Rockstar (lol)
