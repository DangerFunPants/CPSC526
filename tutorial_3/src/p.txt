May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of laissez faire
which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of
the channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who
was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.

âI donât mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.

Foot and mouth disease. Known as Kochâs preparation. Serum and
virus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperorâs horses at
MÃ¼rzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price.
Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant
question. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.

âI want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at
the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can
be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They
offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the
department. Now Iâm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by
difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.

âMark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
the signs of a nationâs decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
nationâs vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure
as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
destruction. Old England is dying.

He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.

âDying, he said again, if not dead by now.

     The harlotâs cry from street to street
     Shall weave old Englandâs windingsheet.
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
he halted.

âA merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew
or gentile, is he not?

âThey sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
earth to this day.

On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but
knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain
patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their
years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.

âWho has not? Stephen said.

âWhat do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.

He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.

âHistory, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to
awake.

From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?

âThe ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.

Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:

âThat is God.

Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!

âWhat? Mr Deasy asked.

âA shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.

Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.

âI am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought
the strangers to our shore here, MacMurroughâs wife and her leman,
OâRourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many
errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the
end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.

     For Ulster will fight
     And Ulster will be right.
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.

âWell, sir, he began.

âI foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long
at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
wrong.

âA learner rather, Stephen said.

And here what will you learn more?

Mr Deasy shook his head.

âWho knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the
great teacher.

Stephen rustled the sheets again.

âAs regards these, he began.

âYes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
published at once.

Telegraph. Irish Homestead.

âI will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
editors slightly.

âThat will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletradersâ association today at the
City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?

âThe Evening Telegraph...

âThat will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
answer that letter from my cousin.

âGood morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
Thank you.

âNot at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
like to break a lance with you, old as I am.

âGood morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.

He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub
me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.

âMr Dedalus!

Running after me. No more letters, I hope.

âJust one moment.

âYes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.

Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.

âI just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour
of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know
that? No. And do you know why?

He frowned sternly on the bright air.

âWhy, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.

âBecause she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.

A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
his lifted arms waving to the air.

âShe never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. Thatâs why.

On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins.

Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn
and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,
rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By
knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a
millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why
in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it
is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time.
A very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six:
the nacheinander. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles
oâer his base, fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably! I am
getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with
it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs,
nebeneinander. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos. Am
I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick,
crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them aâ.

      Wonât you come to Sandymount,
      Madeline the mare?
Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs
marching. No, agallop: deline the mare.

Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I
open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. Basta! I will see if I can
see.

See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
without end.

They came down the steps from Leahyâs terrace prudently, Frauenzimmer:
and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in
the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.
Number one swung lourdily her midwifeâs bag, the otherâs gamp poked
in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe,
relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One
of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing.
What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed
in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of
all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your
omphalos. Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha:
nought, nought, one.
